JavaScript30- Project 18 Adding Up Times with reduce.

\*\*
Extra: Displayed all data attributes inside HTML and created a new function to add an 0 in front if the number had just one digit. So the total time will have the following format hh:mm:ss.

\*\* Plus some styling using Css Grid on the parent element and Flex inside on the childrenâ€™s.
